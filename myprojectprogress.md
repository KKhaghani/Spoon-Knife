Projects of interest, and how I would organize them:
I have a couple of projects on theoretical back burners, and before this class showed me what open-source software meant, I planned to complete them all as solo projects. Then again, if they were to be open-source:
The first project on the list is a simple dice-rolling application I developed back in middle/high school. It needs a facelift, so I'd like to redo it. I would make this a common repo, rather than a blessed repository. For one, I'm not trying to make any money out of it (it's been done already), and if developers want to fork the repo and take it in another direction, they are welcome to do so.
Overall, this is probably the only project on my mind at the moment, but more will come in time.
